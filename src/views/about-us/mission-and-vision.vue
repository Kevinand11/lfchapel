			<p>We believe God has called us to reach the unchurched in the world at large. This involves creating a Church that can be a safe gathering place for people to come experience the grace and forgiveness and power of God. A family of believers where they can find healing for the things that have hurt and wounded their souls. Where they can be nurtured and discipled into faith in the one true God and in Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Jer. 23:1-4</p>
